# Backlog

Laid out as the `/scope` skill's work-in-progress layout says. An entry's heading starts with its category or project (e.g. `pkmn/site: …`).

## Questions

### League tie edges

On equal league points, the winner of the match between the tied players ranks higher. Since the 5 rounds pair each opponent once (2026-10-22), only three players tied in a loop have no rule yet.

Owner: [Series 1 → Competition Format](../pkmn/series/1/explanation/competition-format.md).

### The losers' triangular

The 3 first-round losers of series 1's final tournament play a triangular, and its winner returns to the semifinals. How it is played has no rule yet: each pair once, and in what match format; and who goes through on a three-way tie.

Owner: [Series 1 → Competition Format](../pkmn/series/1/explanation/competition-format.md).

### Items with the Añil map

In series 1's postgame the islands are closed, but players may keep searching for items with the Añil map. How that works is to be settled with the owner.

## Tasks

### pkmn/site: decide on Team Analysis's explanatory legends

Team Analysis's compare-view legends carry explanatory lines (e.g. "shaded: best switch-in below 1.00 weighted bulk"), which the site's "no helper text" rule forbids ([Design System](../pkmn/site/reference/design-system.md)). The pool view has one of the same kind: "Shading is the percentile in the pool. L legendary, M mythical." (`src/team-analysis/components/pool-view.tsx`).

**Do:**
- [ ] Ask the owner whether the legends stay as an exception or go; record the answer in `docs/pkmn/site/explanation/site.md` → Decisions and apply it; if they stay, name the exception in `design-system.md`'s "No helper text" rule.

**Acceptance:**
- Claude-run: `npm run gate`.
- Human-run: open `/team-analysis` → Compare with two teams and check the legends match the decision.
- Reuse: none.
- Neighbors: none.
- Forbidden: removing a legend's key (colours, symbols) along with its prose.

**Touches:** `pkmn/site/src/team-analysis/`, `docs/pkmn/site/explanation/site.md`, `docs/pkmn/site/reference/design-system.md`
**Needs the author:** do the compare legends' explanations stay as an exception to "no helper text", or go? And the pool view's shading line?

### pkmn/site: decide whether tools may import each other's data

The design-system cleanup moved every shared component into `src/components/`, but Open Sheet still imports `carryTeam` from `src/team-analysis/drafts.ts` to hand a team over to Team Analysis. The cleanup read "no tool imports from another tool's folder" as covering UI only ([site.md → Decisions](../pkmn/site/explanation/site.md#decisions)), and that decision ("One shared version of each UI piece") is written as settled 2026-10-21 although the owner has not answered.

**Do:**
- [ ] Ask the owner; if the rule covers every import, move the hand-over into a shared module (e.g. `src/lib/`), and record the answer in `docs/pkmn/site/explanation/site.md` → Decisions, rewriting the "One shared version of each UI piece" entry, and `design-system.md`.

**Acceptance:**
- Claude-run: `npm run gate` from `pkmn/site/`; `grep -rn "@/team-analysis\|@/open-sheet" pkmn/site/src/open-sheet pkmn/site/src/team-analysis` matches the decision.
- Human-run: in Open Sheet, "Open in Team Analysis" still carries the team over.
- Reuse: `src/team-analysis/drafts.ts`.
- Neighbors: `src/analysis/`.
- Forbidden: changing the hand-over's behaviour.

**Touches:** `pkmn/site/src/`, `docs/pkmn/site/`
**Needs the author:** does "no tool imports from another tool's folder" cover data hand-overs like `carryTeam`, or only UI?

## Ideas

### pkmn/site: series hubs

The home page lists the series, each series has a hub at `/series/<n>`, and Open Sheet and Team Analysis sit under it ([Site → Decisions](../pkmn/site/explanation/site.md#decisions)). What a hub shows is not decided.
